        "The following assignment consists again of a theoretical part (learning portfolio) and a practical part (assignment). The goal is to train a neural model for a recommendation system.\n",
        "\n",
        "The plan would be that in the first week we will discuss your learnings from the theory part, that means you are relatively free to fill your Learning Portfolio on this topic and in the following week we will discuss your solutions of the practical part.\n",
        "\n",
        "In preparation for the practical part, I ask you to familiarize yourself with the following video sources in the next week:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) Please watch the following videos:\n",

        "Note: The first part of the video mainly contains tips for neural networks to submit a Kaggle Competition. For that, you would have to watch the end of the 6th video to understand this better. But this is not mandatory.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) Please download the following notebooks and edit it in Google-Colab. Try to answer a few questions that are asked at the end. Take notes and update your Learning Portfolio.\n",

        "**Collaborative filtering**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Collaborative filtering is a technique used in Recommender Systems, so that past similar preferences of users inform future preferences. It works by displaying the preferences of each user in a vector. The similarity between users is measured as cosine similarity. Computed cosine similarity in turn can be used as weights for the ratings of other users to predict a rating for a certain user.\n",
        "*  Generally, collaborative filtering is a matrix completion problem.\n",
        "*  User and item biases, embedding distances and principal component analysises are ways to interpret collaborative filterings results.\n",
        "*  Collaborative filtering models are trained using latent factors of movies and users.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Limitations of collaborative filtering**\n",
        "\n",
        "* One problem of collaborative filtering is the grey sheep problem, where a user has similarities with different types of users and can not be clearly matched to one of the groups. Predicting ratings using user metadata can help in these cases.\n",
        "* One problem of collaborative filtering is the black sheep problem, where a user has no similarities with other users. Predicting ratings using user metadata can help in these cases.\n",
        "* One problem of collaborative filtering is Matrix sparsity, where very few users actually rate products. In such cases, user actions on those items (views, etc.) can be used to predict ratings.\n",
        "* As embedding matrices can become quite huge in real life scenarios, lots of computation power may be needed. Usual methods such a batching and gradient accumulation can be used to mitigate this.\n",
        "* Certain subgroups overrepresenting the user base can introduce bias to the ratings. This bias in turn attracts more users of the group and the bias becomes stronger. Monitoring the system involving humans is required to solve this issue.\n",
        "* The bootstrapping problem is related to the fact that new items and users do not have every rating. One solution to the problem is to user item or user metadata to predict initial ratings and replace those ratings over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Machine Learning General Concepts**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Overfitting of models can be mitigated using L2 Regularization where a penalty is imposed proportionally to current parameter estimations to the loss function.\n",
        "* Gradient Accumulation can be used to decrease batch sizes and still train as if higher batch sizes would have been processed. This is relevant for decreasing GPU memory usage.\n",
        "* Rule of thumb: Dividing the batch size by two should result in a reduction of the learning rate by 2.\n",
        "* Softmax is the exponentiated prediction of the model divided by the sum of exponentiated predictions over every class. It is best suitable for models where exactly one class should be predicted as the output\n",
        "* Cross entropy is the log of the softmax output for the actual prediction category\n",
        "* Multi-target models work by calculating different losses for the outputs standing for the respective targets and adding them together. The training will then as usual tweak weights to reduce the loss.\n",
        "* A Dot Product is the sum of the multiplication of two vectors\n",
        "* A look-up can be depicted as a multiplication of a vector and a one-hot encoded matrix.\n",

        "\n",
        "A latent factor is an underlying attribute of an item, which is not included in the data set. It is latent, because it is not explicitly in the dataset.\n",

        "**Why does reducing weights lead to better generalization?**\n",
        "\n",
        "By including the penalty term, L2 regularization encourages the model to find a balance between fitting the training data well (low loss) and keeping the weights small (low penalty). As a result, it tends to push the model towards smaller weight values and less overfitting of data.\n",

        "\n",
        "There are several possibilites. One of them is to set the ratings  to reflect the average taste initially and slowly replace by the ratings. Another solution is to ask questions to generate some user metadata and user the user metadata to predict an initial set of ratings.\n",

        "**How can feedback loops impact collaborative filtering systems?**\n",
        "\n",
        "If a small number of your users tend to set the direction of your recommendation system, then they are naturally going to end up attracting more people like them to your system. And that will, of course, amplify the original representation bias. This type of bias has a natural tendency to be amplified exponentially. \n",

        "**When using a neural network in collaborative filtering, why can we have different numbers of factors for movies and users?**\n",

        "\n",
        "In the context of the CollabNN model, the nn.Sequential is used to define the overall architecture of the model by stacking multiple layers together. It helps in creating a sequential flow of data through the layers, where the output of one layer serves as the input to the next layer. This allows the model to learn hierarchical representations of the input data.\n",

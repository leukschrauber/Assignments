        "The following assignment consists of a theoretical part (learning portfolio) and a practical part (assignment). The goal is to build a classification model that predicts from which subject area a certain abstract originates. The plan would be that next week we will discuss your learnings from the theory part, that means you are relatively free to fill your Learning Portfolio on this new topic and in two weeks we will discuss your solutions of the Classification Model.\n",

        "The research field is determined by the name of the file.\n",

        "2) We need a training dataset and a test dataset. My suggestion would be that for each research field we use the first 5700 lines for the training dataset and the last 300 lines for the test dataset. Please stick to this because then we can compare our models better!\n",
        "\n",
        "3) Please use a pre-trained model from huggingface to build a classification model that tries to predict the correct research field from the 26. Please calculate the accuracy and the overall accuracy for all research fields. If you solve this task in a group, you can also try different pre-trained models. In addition to the abstracts, you can also see if the model improves if you include keywords and titles.\n",

A rigourous treatment and a background familiarity with the underlying physics behind mathematics are covered, giving a detailed description and interpretation of the main microphysical phenomena, removing unsound popular beliefs. The basis are given for non-destructive diagnostics to evaluate causes of damage determined by atmospheric factors, as well as negative consequences of the unsound use of technology and mass tourism. To this aim, suggestions are given on the fundamental principles in designing heating, air conditioning, lighting and in reducing the deposition of pollutants on works of art. Theory and experience are coupled to describe the complex condensation mechanisms and the fundamental role played by water in the stone deterioration and the formation of crusts on monuments. Urban meteorology, air-surface interactions, atmospheric stability, dispersion and deposition of airborne pollutants are also key topics of this book, for which the main aim has been to make comprehensible to a wider audience a matter that is only familiar to a few specialists. This book combines a theoretical background with many years of accurate laboratory research, field surveys and practice. The first part, devoted to applied theory, is a concise treatise on microphysics, which includes a survey on the basic ideas which are necessary for environmental diagnostic and conservation. The second part of the book focuses on the practical utilisation and shows in detail how field surveys should be performed, with many suggestions and examples and the indication of some common errors that should be avoided.\",\n\"Microclimate for cultural heritage\"],\n [{\n            'v': 385,\n            'f': \"385\",\n        },\n\" messenger rna; protein kinase; amino acid sequence; animal cell; article; autosomal dominant disorder; cell hybridization; codon; controlled study; genetic variability; hamster; human; human cell; molecular cloning; myotonic dystrophy; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; rna transcription; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Chromosome Mapping; Cloning, Molecular; Cyclic AMP; Gene Expression Regulation; Human; Molecular Sequence Data; Myotonic Dystrophy; Pedigree; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Protein Kinases; Sequence Alignment; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Animalia; Cricetinae\",\n\"AGRI\",\n\"Using positional cloning strategies, we have identified a CTG triplet repeat that undergoes expansion in myotonic dystrophy patients. This sequence is highly variable in the normal population. PCR analysis of the interval containing this repeat indicates that unaffected individuals have between 5 and 27 copies. Myotonic dystrophy patients who are minimally affected have at least 50 repeats, while more severely affected patients have expansion of the repeat containing segment up to several kilobase pairs. The CTG repeat is transcribed and is located in the 3\\u2032 untranslated region of an mRNA that is expressed in tissues affected by myotonic dystrophy.

During the past 6 decades, hundreds of empirical studies have resulted in a variety of rules of thumb that specify how humans systematically deviate from what is normatively expected from their decisions. Several complementary generative mechanisms have been proposed to explain those cognitive biases. Here it is suggested that (at least) 8 of these empirically detected decision-making biases can be produced by simply assuming noisy deviations in the memory-based information processes that convert objective evidence (observations) into subjective estimates (decisions). An integrative framework is presented to show how similar noise-based mechanisms can lead to conservatism, the Bayesian likelihood bias, illusory correlations, biased self-other placement, subadditivity, exaggerated expectation, the confidence bias, and the hard-easy effect. Analytical tools from information theory are used to explore the nature and limitations that characterize such information processes for binary and multiary decision-making exercises. The ensuing synthesis offers formal mathematical definitions of the biases and their underlying generative mechanism, which permits a consolidated analysis of how they are related. This synthesis contributes to the larger goal of creating a coherent picture that explains the relations among the myriad of seemingly unrelated biases and their potential psychological generative mechanisms.

The technique analyzes ongoing low-frequency fluctuations in the blood oxygen level-dependent signal. Through patterns of spatial coherence, these fluctuations can be used to identify the networks within the brain. Multiple brain networks are present simultaneously, and the relationships within and between networks are in constant dynamic flux. Resting state fMRI functional connectivity analysis is increasingly used to detect subtle brain network differences and, in the case of pathophysiology, subtle abnormalities in illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The sequence of events leading up to dementia has been hypothesized to begin many years or decades before any clinical symptoms occur. Here we review the findings across rs-fMRI studies in the spectrum of preclinical AD to clinical AD. In addition, we discuss evidence for underlying preclinical AD mechanisms, including an important relationship between resting state functional connectivity and brain metabolism and how this results in a distinctive pattern of amyloid plaque deposition in default mode network regions. \\u00a9 2013 Society of Biological Psychiatry.\",\n\"Resting state functional connectivity in preclinical Alzheimer's disease\"],\n [{\n            'v': 1293,\n            'f': \"1293\",\n        },\n\" chemoattractant; chitin; chitobiose; chitotriosidase; transcriptome; article; bacterial cell; bacterial colonization; cell migration; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; enzyme localization; epithelium; gene expression; host pathogen interaction; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; pyrosequencing; squid; symbiont; transcriptomics; upregulation; Vibrio fischeri; Bacteria (microorganisms); Cephalopoda; Vibrio fischeri; Aliivibrio fischeri; Animals; Chemotactic Factors; Chitin; Chitinase; Decapodiformes; Disaccharides; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Molecular Sequence Data; Mucus; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Symbiosis\",\n\"AGRI\",\n\"Upon transit to colonization sites, bacteria often experience critical priming that prepares them for subsequent, specific interactions with the host; however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly described. During initiation of the symbiosis between the bacterium Vibrio fischeri and its squid host, which can be observed directly and in real time, approximately five V. fischeri cells aggregate along the mucociliary membranes of a superficial epithelium prior to entering host tissues. Here, we show that these few early host-associated symbionts specifically induce robust changes in host gene expression that are critical to subsequent colonization steps. This exquisitely sensitive response to the host's specific symbiotic partner includes the upregulation of a host endochitinase, whose activity hydrolyzes polymeric chitin in the mucus into chitobiose, thereby priming the symbiont and also producing a chemoattractant gradient that promotes V. fischeri migration into host tissues. Thus, the host responds transcriptionally upon initial symbiont contact, which facilitates subsequent colonization. \\u00a9 2013 Elsevier Inc.\",\n\"Initial symbiont contact orchestrates host-organ-wide transcriptional changes that prime tissue colonization\"],\n [{\n            'v': 1376,\n            'f': \"1376\",\n        },\n\" \",\n\"AGRI\",\n\"There are two purposes to the present study. Our methodological purpose is to develop and test a procedure and instrument for assessing crime- and fear-related features of the urban residential environment. We examine three classes of cues: symbols of social and physical disorder, territorial functioning, and architectural 'defensible space' features. Past research examining the physical environment correlates of fear of crime has relied almost exclusively on subjective perceptions of the environment rather than on independent and objective measures thereof. Our theoretical purpose is to test the 'disorder' thesis of Skogan, and Wilson and Kelling, that actual physical incivilities erode resident's confidence in their neighborhood and lead them to infer that serious local problems, unrelated to the physical environment, are serious. We conducted environmental assessments and resident interviews (n = 412) on 50 blocks in 50 Baltimore neighborhoods. The assessments demonstrated high levels of inter-rater reliability and concurrent validity, controlling for social class. Regression analyses showed that physical incivilities were independently linked to perceptions of social and crime-related problems. The results show that reliable and valid assessment of crime- and fear-related environmental features can be conducted. They also support the central kernel of the Wilson and Kelling, and Skogan thesis, that the actual presence of disorder-related cues engender perceptions of social and crime problems. \\u00a9 1992 Academic Press Ltd.\",\n\"The physical environment of street blocks and resident perceptions of crime and disorder: implications for theory and measurement\"],\n [{\n            'v': 1715,\n            'f': \"1715\",\n        },\n\"Cathode material; Crystal structure; Iron silicate; Lithium-ion battery; Manganese silicate Cathodes; Crystal structure; Electric wiring; Electrochemistry; Electronic structure; Ionic conduction; Lithium batteries; Cathode materials; Iron silicate; Lithium-ion batteries; Lithium compounds\",\n\"AGRI\",\n\"Recently, preparation and preliminary testing of Li2FeSiO 4, a representative of a new class of Li storage materials, has been reported [A. Nyten, A. Abouimrane, M. Armand, T. Gustaffson, J.O. Thomas, Electrochem. Commun. 7 (2005) 156]. In the present paper, we report preparation of another material from this class: Li2MnSiO4. To the best of our knowledge, the existence of this compound has not been reported so far. Similarly as in the case of the LiMPO4 materials family (M = Fe, Mn), the Mn analogue shows considerably poorer electrochemical performance. Quite unexpectedly, however, the Mn analogue shows a better stability, especially under harsh conditions. This property appears to be crucial for determination of detailed structural features of this class of materials. The obtained structure reveals partial occupation of alternate tetrahedral sites by Li and Mn, thus implying a high ionic conductivity of these materials. The poor electrochemical performance is most likely due to poor electron wiring. \\u00a9 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We first discuss how hedonic and nonhedonic settings differ and some sufficient conditions for the existence of core stable coalition partitions in hedonic settings. We then focus on a weaker stability condition: individual stability, where no player can benefit from moving to another coalition while not hurting the members of that new coalition. We show that if coalitions can be ordered according to some characteristic over which players have single-peaked preferences, or where players have symmetric and additively separable preferences, then there exists an individually stable coalition partition. Examples show that without these conditions, individually stable coalition partitions may not exist. We also discuss some other stability concepts, and the incompatibility of stability with other normative properties.

Effectively, we compute a measure that says \\\"two objects are similar if they are related to similar objects.\\\" This general similarity measure, called SimRank, is based on a simple and intuitive graph-theoretic model.
